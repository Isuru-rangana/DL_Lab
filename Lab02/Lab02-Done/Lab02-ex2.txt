Q1: What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase? 
the model tends to overfit the training data

Q2: Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
as the number of hidden nodes increases, the modelâ€™s accuracy improves significantly because it can capture more complex patterns in the data. However, beyond a certain point, adding more hidden nodes causes the accuracy to fluctuate and may even decrease due to overfitting.
